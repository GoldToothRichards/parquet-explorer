# Parquet Explorer

**A browser-based SQL editor for the blockchain.**

Parquet Explorer is a web application that allows users to upload, store, and query Parquet files directly in the browser. It leverages blockchain technology for secure storage and WebAssembly for local-first data processing. This architecture allows for the analysis of surprisingly large datasets, despite the performance limitations of web browsers and the resource constraints of the Internet Computer blockchain. This project is meant to demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging familiar data formats and analysis tools in a blockchain context.

## ‚ú® Features

- Upload and store Parquet files on-chain using [Juno Storage](https://juno.build/docs/build/storage)
- Client-side query processing via [DuckDB WASM](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/wasm/overview)
- Interactive SQL editor for querying Parquet data
- Metadata visualization for uploaded Parquet files
- Secure authentication powered by Internet Identity
- Zero setup required to start exploring your data
