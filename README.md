# Parquet Explorer

**A browser-based SQL editor for the blockchain.**

## üìö Description

Parquet Explorer is a web application that allows users to upload, store, and query Parquet files directly in the browser. It leverages blockchain technology for secure storage and WebAssembly for local-first data processing. This architecture allows for the analysis of surprisingly large datasets, despite the performance limitations of web browsers and the resource constraints inherent to the Internet Computer Protocol. This project is meant to demonstrate the feasibility of adapting familiar data formats and analysis tools such as Parquet and SQL for use in a fully decentralized blockchain application.

## ‚úÖ  Features

- Upload and store Parquet files on-chain using [Juno Storage](https://juno.build/docs/build/storage)
- Client-side query processing via [DuckDB WASM](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/wasm/overview)
- Interactive SQL editor for querying Parquet data
- Metadata visualization for uploaded Parquet files
- Secure authentication powered by Internet Identity
- Zero setup required to start exploring your data

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
